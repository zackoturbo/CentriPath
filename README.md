# CentriPath
Meridional path creator for centrifugal turbo machinery applications.

## Introduction
In the geometrical design process for centrifugal turbomachines, such as centrifugal pumps and compressors, a meridonal path has to be designed.
The meridonal path combines the inlet and outlet of the impeller. Usually, arcs are used for the hub, mean and shroud path. 
Bezier curves are used as well to construct a path.
When using arcs, the hub path is often designed using two arcs. The shroud can be designed using one arc or, to keep the axial length short, two arcs. 
The arcs are tangent to specific lines at the inlet and the outlet. At the inlet a horizontal line is usually used before entering into the arc. This improves the axial inflow conditions to the leading edge. 
At the outlet vertical lines (hub path) and angled lines (shroud path) are used. The radial length of the vertical line at the hub path and the angle and length of the line at the shroud path vary from impeller to impeller.
